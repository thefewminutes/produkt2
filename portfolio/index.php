                <p><a href="http://www.snailhq.com/" target="_blank">Snail</a> is a hard rock band that needed a simple showcase website with a shopping cart to sell tshirts, CDs and other merchandise. I created their website using CSS, XHTML (transitional), javascript and the VPASP shopping cart component with a MySql backend. I recently updated this website with a new &quot;look&quot; including new graphics (provided by a band member) and an updated stylesheet.</p>

           	  </hgroup>
              <p>When I started working for Seattle University Bookstore it was apparent that the website had been maintained by students. There were links that went nowhere, outdated content, a navigation structure that looked like it had been planned by Salvador Dali, gaping security holes, glaring compatibility issues, and outdated html. I created a new graphic template for them with a new information architecture and improved user interface. I created Flash animations to give the website a little life. I also went through their html code page by page and validated it as much as possible according to w3c standards. The result was an incredible increase in traffic and sales metrics. They also saw a drastic increase in keyword relevancy and search engine visibility. In many cases SU Bookstore had #1 ranking for targeted keywords.</p>

              <p>Roosevelt School of the Arts had a pre-existing website that was outdated and an entire laundry list of sections they wanted built with a backend database. They provided me with a graphic template and I created their website from scratch using CSS, XHTML, PHP, MySql and Javascript. I created a password-protected administrative website for uploading and managing photos and videos, managing their faculty, staff, and email signups. I built their front end so that it was secure and data-driven.</p>

They also needed to improve their search engine visibility. They had previously hired a web development firm to do so, but the resulting shopping cart didn't work and displayed sensitive data in the URL. I installed, customized and configured their new shopping cart and hooked it up to their existing Internet Merchant account. I also performed SEO services on a few pages and was able to gain some top positions for relevant keywords in major search engines.</p>

              <p>PWCSI approached me to redesign their website in terms of layout, Interface Design, and Information Architecture. Their present site at the time was extremely difficult to navigate and consisted of CGI scripts, which were not ranking well in the search engines at that time. I converted their entire site to HTML/ASP, created a new interface and redesigned the Information Architecture to make more sense as users were complaining about the inability to find things. I also performed SEO services on the entire site and was able to increase relevancy and ranking dramatically.</p>

              <p>IMG2 was a web design firm at the peak of the Internet craze. We had a steady infusion of venture capital but no real solid business model. As a result, our business model was constantly changing; what started as a Web Design Firm/Nationally Syndicated Radio Show ended up (at various iterations) as a streaming media service, a school for training techies (similar to Lynda.com), a local weekly newspaper, and finally an Ultimate Fighting magazine that sponsored fighting events at casinos. This is where I was given the imperative to either sink or swim as a developer because I had to adapt to these new business models rapidly. Every change meant building a new website, new interface, new information architecture, and new SEO treatments. Not to mention all the networking and bandwidth issues related to delivering streaming audio and video, something that was a constant in every business model. The website was built using classic ASP, had a SQL Server 7 backend, and included an extensive password-protected admin in every iteration.</p>

The site was built using classic ASP and an Access database backend. It included various dynamic news and reviews sections, a place for bands to post their upcoming concerts (which displayed publicly by state, region, etc), free mp3 downloads, and tons of user-submitted content including interviews. It also had an extensive protected admin. It was essentially a music magazine with interactive capabilities. At one time newmetal.com was one of the top 2 metal websites alongside lambgoat.com, and was listed in The Indie Bible.</p>
